# Sentiment Analysis using NLP for Flipkart Reviews
### (Xebia Internship Project)
## Problem Statement
Use web scraping to collect at least 30,000 product reviews from Flipkart.com and perform a sentiment analysis using NLP to predict the polarity of reviews as Positive, Negative or Neutral.
## Objectives
1. Understanding the basics of data collection using web scraping tools
2. Understanding theoretical and practical background about sentiment analysis
3. Application of varied NLP libraries
4. Implementing an ML model for sentiment analysis
5. Deploying the Machine Learning model
## Project Summary
